Works in 16 pin mode. I know these devices can also work in 8 pin mode or something, so feel free to update my code if you need to free up more pins. I haven't touched this code in years.

This goes without saying but be sure to check the datasheet of your device to make sure the code is compatible with it. Don't assume this will just work because you might burn out your display and your MCU. But it worked fine for me on an Arduino Mega with a couple different displays.
